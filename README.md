<u>**Objective and Problem Definition**</u>  

The **AI Timetable Generator** project aims to automate the creation of academic timetables to optimize scheduling while preventing conflicts like teacher overlaps and room double bookings.  
This is a significant challenge in many educational institutions due to the complexity of balancing numerous constraints such as staff availability, classroom capacity, lunch breaks, and multi-class scheduling.  

The manual process of scheduling is labor-intensive and error-prone, often resulting in inefficient allocations and clashes.  
Our project delivers a **user-friendly web-based solution** that integrates advanced scheduling algorithms with real-time validation and export functionalities.  

The expected outcome is a **robust platform** that simplifies academic timetable management for administrators and enhances overall academic workflow efficiency.
